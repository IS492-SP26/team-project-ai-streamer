✍️ How AI Was Used

AI tools were used to assist writing, synthesis, and organization.

All outputs were reviewed, edited, and refined by team members before submission.

Literature insights reflect our own interpretation and understanding.

AI was not used to fabricate results, experiments, or citations.

🔐 Privacy & Responsible Use

No API keys, credentials, or sensitive data were shared.

Example livestream chat scenarios are synthetic or anonymized.

We followed course guidelines regarding attribution and transparency.

📌 Attribution

If any external code, datasets, or prompts are reused in later stages, they will be clearly cited in the repository.
